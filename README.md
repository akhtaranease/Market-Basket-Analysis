This project uses association rule mining to uncover frequent item combinations from customer transaction data.  
The goal is to help retailers identify product bundling opportunities, improve store layout, and drive cross-sell strategies.

---

## 📌 Overview

We used the Apriori algorithm to identify patterns in shopping baskets from over 29,000 retail transactions.  
This method reveals which items are commonly purchased together and how strong their associations are — measured using support, confidence, and lift.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

`Python` · `Pandas` · `Matplotlib` · `Apyori`

---

## ✅ Key Tasks

- Cleaned and prepared transactional data structured across 40 item columns
- Transformed data into basket format for use with Apriori
- Ran multiple experiments by adjusting support and confidence thresholds
- Visualized top 10 most frequently purchased items
- Interpreted strong rules with high lift for real-world application

---

## 📊 Sample Rule

> **ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE RED → ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE GREEN**  
> Confidence: 64% | Lift: 18.0  
> _This suggests customers often buy one colour when they buy the other — ideal for bundling._

---

## 📈 Result

- Generated **30+ association rules** with high confidence and lift
- Identified strong pairings like `'BREAD' → 'BUTTER'` and `'TEACUP' → 'SAUCER'`
- Visualized top item frequencies to understand purchase trends

---

## 🔁 Future Expansion

With access to richer datasets (e.g., price, quantity, customer ID), this analysis could be extended to:
- Revenue-weighted rules
- Personalized product recommendations
- Customer-segment-specific insights

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

Association rule mining reveals patterns in purchasing behavior that often go unnoticed.  
By uncovering these patterns, businesses can make smarter decisions about product placement, combo deals, and marketing strategies.
